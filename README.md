## Instructions From Code Institute


Guidelines for project development:

- Create a website of around 4-5 pages.
- Incorporate main navigation and grid layout.
- Whenever possible, strive to use semantic HTML5 elements to structure your HTML code better.
- Make sure your site is as responsive as possible. You can test this by checking the website on different screen sizes and browsers.
- We advise that you write down user stories and create wireframes/mockups before embarking on full-blown development.
- The site can also make use of CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap.
- You should conduct and document tests to ensure that all of your websiteâ€™s functionality works well.
- Write a README.md file for your project.
- Use Git & GitHub for version control.
- Deploy the final version of your code to a hosting platform such as GitHub Pages.



## Purpose


This website provides event bookers, current fans and future fans an opportunity to watch and listen to the bands back catalog of videos and songs. Information about new material and free access to new songs will also be made available here.

The website provides pictures and information about the band, as well as links to their social media accounts and Wiki page. Several booking options for private events are available and clearly presented.

 
 
## UX


### Wireframes

[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) was used to create the wireframes.

### Design


- Development of the website adhered to a mobile first approach. The site consists of four separate pages. Two of the audio tracks, and a customer story, have been hidden on smaller screens to improve the aesthetic.

- All pages share the same navbar and footer, though each page has a clear purpose and some unique functionality.
  
- The Bootstrap framework underpins the project and was implemented as per convention.

- The project also made use of the CloudFlare and Font Awesome libraries.

- The websites color scheme and layout were chosen in an attempt to represent the Animals long standing brand style with their peak popularity coming in the 1960s. A retro, classic-style approach was undertaken; to invoke The Animals experience.

- Two of the audio tracks on the music page, and one user testimonial from the customers page, are not displayed on some smaller screen sizes. This was done in an attempt to improve the user experience.
 
- The website includes a side article regards the bands ongoing activism in the field of animal rights and welfare. Customers are informed that 20% of all band earnings are made available to several animal charities. A link is provided for users if they would like to visit the webpage of one of their favorite [charities](https://www.worldanimalprotection.org/). It is hoped that this commitment may be appealing to potential customers and increase event bookings.






### User Stories


Several user stories were considered before development began:

1. "As a current Animals fan I want to be able to quickly access the bands music online via an official website. I also want to be up-to-date with new material, news and announcements."
 
2. "As a current Animals fan I would like to recommend an official Animals website to my friends (as potential new fans). So that they can watch and listen to the bands videos and music; and learn more about the bands history."

3. "As a potential Animals fan, I would appreciate access to an official band website were I can easily access the bands material for free. I would also like to see some pictures of the band and be provided with up-to date information about the band."

4. "As a potential customer who is considering booking the band for an event, I want easy access to the means of doing so through an official website. I also want quick access to some of their greatest hits which I would expect to find freely available on their website. Furthermore, I would like access to useful information such as band availability and event prices. Again, I would expect this information to be clearly presented and easily accessible via the bands website."

5. "As a current fan interested in the day to day news and activities of the band, I would like to be provided easily accessed links to their social media accounts, so that I can follow them and be the first to know of any exciting developments."

### Further Testing

- Google chrome developer tools where used at every stage of production to
isolate issues and improve mobile responsiveness.
- The app has been tested on various browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Safari.
- The app was tested across many screen sizes, from very small to very large.
- Some family members tested the app on their own devices and their recommendations, such as which band picture might be best for each page, were taken on board.
- The app is displaying as intended across various devices and in different browsers.


### Issues

- The logo image top left of each page only slides in from the left on the index page (when the page is loaded). It was originally intended that it would perform this action on every page. However, it only ever worked on the index page. After considerable time spent, and a discussion regards same with a mentor; the author was unable to fix the issue. Thus, a separate class was created for this style  so that it was unique to the index page. The remaining pages share another class, which does not include a slide in from left style.

- On very large or very small screen sizes the band pictures may display as significantly more zoomed in or zoomed out. This isn't ideal as some band members, or band members heads may not be visible on viewports at either end of the scale. This could be addressed using image-editing software such as [Photoshop](https://www.photoshop.com) to create various photo sizes for various screen sizes, although it may be quite time consuming.

- The embedded Youtube videos also show a logo of the Youtuber who has shared the content. It would be preferable aesthetically if these logos were not present. The author attempted to remove the logos with some custom styles, but was unsuccessful.

## Deployment


The website has been deployed to [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and can be accessed [here](https://markwilde33.github.io/CI-project-one/)

This project has been saved to a Github repository from the beginning of development. Hosting it to Github Pages was very straightforward. In the repository, from the settings menu, Github Pages was activated and the master branch was included as the source. A message is then generated by Github containing the following information: Your site is published at https://markwilde33.github.io/CI-project-one/

In my case when I clicked on the link it returned a 404 error. After visiting [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11577147/how-to-fix-page-404-on-github-page), I took the following advice:

``` 
<!-- input the following commands in your terminal -->

$ git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger rebuild"

$ git push
```
This fixed the issue and the website loaded as intended.



## Installation


``` 
from the console type:

$ git clone https://github.com/markwilde33/CI-project-one.git
$ cd CI-project-one

Open index.html in your web browser.
```
App available at http://127.0.0.1:5000/
